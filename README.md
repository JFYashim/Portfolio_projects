# Jonathan Felix Yashim - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About Me
Hi, I'm Jonathan! As a detail-oriented and analytical Agriculture Science graduate, I've developed a strong foundation in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. With a solid understanding of statistical principles and research methods, I've expanded my skill set to include Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau. I'm excited to apply my unique blend of agricultural knowledge and data analysis skills to drive insights and inform decisions in data-driven industries. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data analyst. 

During my studies, I honed my skills with a strong foundation in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Leveraging my skills in statistical analysis and research, i've developed proficiency in Python and SQL for data analysis with the ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst. I'm excited to apply my unique perspective and skills to drive insights and inform decisions in data driven industries.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** MySQL
