# Jonathan Felix Yashim - Data Analyst
## About Me
Hi, I'm Jonathan! a detail-oriented and analyst, I've developed a strong foundation in data collection, analysis, and interpretation during my undergraduate programm and work experience. With a solid understanding of statistical principles and research methods, I've expanded my skill set to include Python, SQL, machine learning both supervised and unsupervised models and and advance data visualization tools like Tableau. I'm excited to apply my unique blend of agricultural knowledge and data analysis skills to drive insights and inform decisions in data-driven industries. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data analyst. 

During my undergraduate and with my vast experience, I honed my skills with a strong foundation in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Leveraging my skills in statistical analysis and research, i've developed proficiency in Python and SQL for data analysis with the ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst. I'm excited to apply my unique perspective and skills to drive insights and inform decisions in data driven industries.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
